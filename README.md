# Hello-World
Just a repository

Hello,

My name is Gabe and welcome to my github page. 
  
  After year of specializing in video production, I have discovered the cross over of video production and programming. Over the past year, I have been working on learning programming skills. It all began when I took an introductory course in GIs (Geographic Information Science). During this course, I learned about all the amazing automation available for GIS if one knew who to write scripts to automate basic tasks. After that course, I took a course in computer science that was designed for graphic arts students to translate their knowledge into computer science terms, and structures. I discovered that my training in video production makes me a strong candidate to create asethically appealing web content. This page showcases some projects I have worked on during my training so far.
  
  Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy,
  
  Gabe
