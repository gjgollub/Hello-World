# Hello-World
Just a repository

Hello,

My name is Gabe and welcome to my github page. 
  
  After years of specializing in video production, I have discovered the crossover between video production and programming. Over the past year, I have been working on my programming skills. It all began when I took an introductory course in GIS (Geographic Information Science). During this course, I learned that writing scripts to automate basic tasks gives a cartographer almost limitless possibilies.  After that course, I took a course in computer science that was designed for graphic arts students to translate their knowledge into computer science terms, and structures. I uncovered an interest in software and web development that I had never known. I have continuned to work tirelessly to make the web a more usable place. I got hooked on learning the mathematics side, and began to work on learning java to practice with Project Euler. My hope is to development my web design skills to become a User Experience Designer. If we can ease the way people interact with computers, the possibilities for humanity are endless!
  
 This page showcases some projects I have worked on during my training so far.
  
  Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy,
  
  Gabe
